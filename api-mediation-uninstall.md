# Uninstalling API Mediation Layer

You can uninstall API Mediation Layer when you no longer want to use the product.

**Note:** Be aware of the following considerations:

-   You might need super-user authority to run this command.
-   You must identify the API Mediation installation directory correctly. Running a recursive remove command with the incorrect directory name can delete critical files.

**Follow these steps:**

1.  Stop your API Mediation Layer services using the following command:

    ```
    C ZOWESVR
    ```

2.  Delete the `ZOWESVR` member from your system `PROCLIB` data set.
3.  Remove RACF® \(or equivalent\) definitions using the following command:

    ```
    RDELETE STARTED (ZOWESVR.*)
    SETR RACLIST(STARTED) REFRESH
    REMOVE (userid) GROUP(IZUUSER)
    ```

4.  Delete the z/OS® UNIX™ System Services API Mediation Layer directory and files from the API Mediation Layer installation directory using the following command:

    ```sh
    rm -R /var/zowe_install_directory/api-mediation #*Zowe Installation Directory*
    ```
